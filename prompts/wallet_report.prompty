Use this table to interpret the wallet's credit score and risk category in your report.

You are a blockchain credit analyst. Generate a comprehensive markdown report analyzing the credit profile of an Ethereum wallet by combining both on-chain blockchain behavior and off-chain persona data.

**Wallet Address:** {{ wallet_address }}
**Credit Score:** {{ credit_score }}
**Total Transactions:** {{ transaction_count }}


**Key Features (On-chain & Off-chain):**
{% for k, v in features_preview %}
- {{ k }}: {{ v }}
{% endfor %}

**Analysis Guidelines:**
- **On-chain features** (transaction patterns, volume, counterparties, contract interactions, etc.) provide objective behavioral evidence
- **Off-chain features** (age, gender, occupation, income, experience, social media presence, etc.) provide demographic and socioeconomic context
- Correlate on-chain and off-chain data to build a holistic credit profile
- Consider how demographic factors (age, occupation, income) align with blockchain activity patterns
- Assess whether the wallet holder's experience level matches their transaction sophistication
- Evaluate social media presence and professional network size as trust indicators

**FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Keep the report SHORT and CONCISE - aim for clarity over length
- Use BULLET POINTS extensively - avoid long paragraphs
- Organize data in TABLES where appropriate (e.g., profile details, key metrics)
- Use clear section headers with brief content
- Each bullet point should be 1-2 lines maximum
- Include specific numbers but keep descriptions brief

Generate a professional markdown report with the following sections:

## 1. Executive Summary
- 2-3 bullet points maximum
- Overall creditworthiness assessment
- Key highlights from both on-chain and off-chain data

## 2. Credit Score Analysis
| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Credit Score | [score] | [grade + risk level] |
| Expected Bad Rate | [%] | [interpretation] |

- 2-3 bullets on key contributing factors

## 3. Profile Overview
| Attribute | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Age | {{ offchain_data.age }} | Off-chain persona age |
| Occupation | {{ offchain_data.occupation }} | Off-chain occupation |
| Income Level | ${{ offchain_data.monthly_income_usd }} | Monthly income (USD) |
| Experience | {{ offchain_data.years_of_experience }} years | Professional experience |
